# Summer-of-code---Intro-to-MERN-stack
In the summer of code our mentor provided us material about git and gitbash, javascript, HTML and CSS; then we entered in backend that is express JS, restful api, http, https and node js. After that we came back again on frontend that is react.
I have mostly covered all the material shared by my mentor.
But was unable to fully complete any of the assignments though I have started each of them and will do it at earliest may be in this week itself.

Just edited it to commit a change via github.
