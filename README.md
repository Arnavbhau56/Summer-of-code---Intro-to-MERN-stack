# Summer-of-code---Intro-to-MERN-stack
In the summer of code our mentor provided us material about git and gitbash, javascript, HTML and CSS; then we entered in backend that is express JS, restful api, http, https and node js. After that we came back again on frontend that is react. After that we learnt about how to manage database through mongoDB and then tried to make a basic course selling application.
I have mostly covered all the material shared by my mentor.
